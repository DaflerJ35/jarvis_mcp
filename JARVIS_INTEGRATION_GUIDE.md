# Desktop JARVIS Integration Guide

This guide explains how to connect your existing desktop JARVIS assistant to the enhanced MCP knowledge system, creating a powerful, unified AI assistant ecosystem.

## Overview

The enhanced MCP system can seamlessly integrate with your desktop JARVIS assistant, allowing:

1. **Shared Knowledge**: Your desktop assistant can access the MCP knowledge base
2. **Bidirectional Communication**: Claude and your desktop JARVIS can communicate with each other
3. **Unified Learning**: Knowledge learned by either system is shared with both
4. **Enhanced Capabilities**: Your desktop assistant gains access to all enhanced modules

## Connection Methods

### Method 1: Direct API Connection (Recommended)

If your desktop JARVIS exposes an API, you can connect directly:

```bash
python connect_claude_to_jarvis.py --enhanced --desktop-url http://localhost:5000 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

This establishes a direct connection and provides access to:
- Knowledge queries and updates
- Voice command passing
- Task automation
- Status monitoring

### Method 2: Knowledge Base Integration

If your desktop JARVIS stores knowledge in a compatible format, integrate the knowledge bases:

1. Export your JARVIS knowledge:
   ```bash
   # From your desktop JARVIS
   jarvis-cli export-knowledge --format jsonl --output jarvis_knowledge.jsonl
   ```

2. Import into the MCP system:
   ```bash
   python import_knowledge.py --source jarvis_knowledge.jsonl --target knowledge_base
   ```

### Method 3: Shared Storage

Configure both systems to use the same knowledge storage:

1. Update your desktop JARVIS configuration to point to the MCP knowledge location:
   ```yaml
   # In your desktop JARVIS config
   knowledge_base:
     type: "shared"
     location: "/path/to/mcp_jarvis/knowledge_base"
   ```

2. Ensure file permissions allow both systems to read/write to the storage.

## Integration API Endpoints

When connected, your desktop JARVIS should expose these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/status` | Get system status |
| `/voice/command` | Send voice commands |
| `/knowledge/query` | Query knowledge base |
| `/knowledge/update` | Add new knowledge |
| `/task/execute` | Execute automation tasks |

## Required Desktop JARVIS Capabilities

For full integration, your desktop JARVIS should support:

1. **API Access**: HTTP/REST or WebSocket endpoints
2. **Knowledge Base Queries**: Ability to search and retrieve knowledge
3. **Knowledge Updates**: Ability to add new knowledge
4. **Voice Processing**: Speech synthesis capabilities
5. **Task Execution**: Ability to run automation tasks

## Using the Integration in Cursor

Once connected, you can use these commands in the Claude-JARVIS connector:

```
desktop:status                         # Get JARVIS status
desktop:voice:Hello, run system check  # Send voice command
desktop:knowledge:project timeline     # Query knowledge
desktop:task:send email to team        # Execute a task
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you have trouble connecting:

1. Ensure your desktop JARVIS is running
2. Verify the API endpoint is correct
3. Check if an API key is required
4. Confirm firewall settings allow the connection

### Knowledge Sync Issues

If knowledge isn't syncing properly:

1. Check file permissions on shared knowledge directories
2. Verify knowledge format compatibility
3. Restart both systems to force a refresh

## Further Customization

You can extend the integration by:

1. Creating custom bridges for specific desktop assistant types
2. Adding specialized knowledge transfer protocols
3. Implementing real-time sync between the systems

For any questions or advanced customization needs, refer to the full documentation or create an issue in the project repository.
